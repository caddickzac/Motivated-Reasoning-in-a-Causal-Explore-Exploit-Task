## "Participant" = participant number
## "F5_Raw_Judgment_Value" = raw slider value for function 5 final judgment (0-10 scale; 0=policy A is best; 5=no effect; 10 = policy B is best)
## "F6_Raw_Judgment_Value" = raw slider value for function 6 final judgment (0-10 scale; 0=policy A is best; 5=no effect; 10 = policy B is best)
## "F5_Scored_Judgment_Bias" = coded version of final judgment for function 5. Lower scores are more biased 
###   Calculated by taking the absolute of the preferred outcome value (either 0 or 10) subtracted by raw judgment value 
###   possible values: 0 = no distance from preferred policy, 5 = correct assessment; 10 = maximal distance from preferred policy.
## "F6_Scored_Judgment_Bias" = coded version of final judgment for function 6. Lower scores are more biased 
###   Calculated by taking the absolute of the preferred outcome value (either 0 or 10) subtracted by raw judgment value 
###   possible values: 0 = no distance from preferred policy, 5 = correct assessment; 10 = maximal distance from preferred policy.                      
## "Average_Judgment_Bias" = this value is the average of "F5_Scored_Judgment_Bias" & "F6_Scored_Judgment_Bias". This represents participants average bias for the two non-causal functions (F5/F6)
